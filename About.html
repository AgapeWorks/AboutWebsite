                        <p class="mt-4 text-secondary ms-2">Jacob Kemp is a creative director, designer, and writer
                            whose work focuses on
                            clarity,
                            storytelling, and building uncommonly motivating brands and ideas.
                            In 2023, his work received two Gold Awards in the Graphis International Competition, for
                            Design
                            and Advertising. He was also the recipient of the Silver Grand Prize at the Fifteenth Annual
                            Solas Awards for his personal essay ‘The House Within’ reflecting on creativity during the
                            COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, SPINE Magazine named Kemp an emerging designer to watch in cover
                            design, key art, and illustration. His work has been featured by Communication</p>

                <p class="text-secondary">Arts, It’s Nice That, The World Illustration Awards, and has become a case
                    study for
                    Columbia
                    University/Teachers College Arts Administration Program. In 2023, he will be a guest speaker this
                    year at Parsons/The New School, and New York University.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">Kemp is also an actor known for creating roles on stage, film, and television,
                    having
                    appeared in
                    Black-ish, Why Him, Newsies, and Broad City. Kemp also received a SAG Award for his work as a cast
                    member of the celebrated series, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">Instead of coloring inside the lines, organizing his life into clear divisions
                    – he encourages the
                    strange, beautiful, funny, unpredictable, poetic, messy, honest pieces to come together – and lets
                    them weave a story entirely their own. While the client list and portfolio is diverse, at the heart
                    of his work lies two things: storytelling and identity. Whatever the medium, no matter the scale,
                    his projects all align with one theme: the way we create reflects the way we live our lives.

                    Jacob graduated from Yale cum laude with distinction in the arts, where he was the recipient of the
                    Glenn de Chabert Prize, the Louis S. Gimbel Scholarship, and was a Yale Trust of Boston Scholar.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">He commutes between Boston and New York and is terribly grateful for Amtrak.
